This file records evidence-backed status only. Allowed status values are: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Passed with evidence`, `Blocked`, and `Human review required`.

| Area | Status | Evidence / boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unity project and package baseline | Passed with evidence | Unity `6000.5.6f1`; latest validated source HEAD `380781b`; repository validation clean; compile succeeds |
| Photon Fusion import | Passed with evidence | Fusion 2.1.1 stable build 2177 is present and imported; no public multiplayer claim |
| EditMode and PlayMode regression baseline | Passed with evidence | Latest production-scene validation passes 72/72 EditMode and 29/29 PlayMode tests; see `Docs/QA/LATEST_HEAD_BASELINE.md` |
| Android smoke build | Passed with evidence | Bazaar Bastion development IL2CPP APK (`151,033,372` bytes; SHA-256 `3D83BE32A990F66DE000A7F34A00AF75B54A85CDBF1346F93321304409464789`) built and launched on Lava `ST5GDW23LB004392` only; see `Docs/QA/LATEST_HEAD_BASELINE.md` |
| Web smoke build | Passed with evidence | Bazaar Bastion Web build (`19` files; `132,679,391` bytes) served locally and loaded in Chrome with zero captured error/warning entries; see `Docs/QA/LATEST_HEAD_BASELINE.md` |
| Timeout/winner correctness | Passed with evidence | Deterministic timeout ranking and complete placements implemented; phase-1 EditMode 59/59 and PlayMode 27/27 pass |
| Eliminations and match statistics | Passed with evidence | Instigator-aware combat events now record damage dealt, eliminations, survival time and duplicate-credit prevention; EditMode 70/70 and PlayMode 27/27 pass |
| Explicit fixed simulation clock | In progress | 30 Hz accumulator now also drives bot decisions/navigation/commands; timeout winner ID and next-zone centre are explicit. Full replay/input-buffer audit and broader runtime coverage remain |
| Continuously interpolated Aandhi | Passed with evidence | Warning/closing state, next-radius preview and deterministic interpolation are exposed; EditMode 70/70 and PlayMode 27/27 pass |
| Bot current/next-zone awareness | Passed with evidence | Bot snapshots carry explicit current/next zone centre/radius data and proactively reposition from the fixed clock; EditMode 71/71 and PlayMode 27/27 pass |
| Authoritative rule separation | In progress | Zone damage, pickup availability/respawn, gadget collection/inventory/use cooldown, elimination, placement and results are application-owned; Dhol/Tiffin effect execution and Unity presentation adapters remain |
| Bazaar Bastion production vertical slice | Passed with evidence | Controlled scene copy contains Bazaar palette/architecture plus Pehel and Maya fighter-specific adapters; 72/72 EditMode, 28/28 PlayMode, Lava Android and Chrome Web smoke evidence recorded; presentation remains greybox and human review is required |
| Fighter roster, progression, and complete offline loop | In progress | Common ability/movement interfaces now select fighter-specific Pehel Charge Throw and Maya Decoy adapters; tutorial/offline loop, progression, final presentation and audio remain |
| Visual/audio placeholder foundation | Passed with evidence | `FighterPresentation` supplies replaceable colour rings, health bars, code-driven action states, attack/ability telegraphs and hit/elimination feedback; `BattleRajaAudioDirector` supplies original procedural cues, volume hooks and Web gesture-gated startup. Final art, animation clips, VFX, authored audio and visual approval remain open |
| Canvas match UI foundation | Passed with evidence | `OfflineMatchHud` provides anchored match/zone status, pause/settings, spectator, results/rematch and accessibility-oriented presentation hooks. Final bootstrap/menu flow, localization, controller rebinding, functional aim assist and human UI approval remain open; see ADR-024 and latest-head evidence |
| Real Photon multiplayer | Not started | Imported SDK is not an adapter or multiplayer validation |
| PlayFab/backend/economy | Not started | No production backend claim |
| Performance, soak, multi-browser, and release gates | Not started | No measured release evidence yet |
| Visual/audio/UI approval | Human review required | Current smoke screenshots show greybox/prototype presentation |

## Documentation discrepancy

The requested `Docs/AI/RepositoryAuditAndCompletionGoal.md` path does not exist. The available matching file `Docs/AI/BattleRaja_Repository_Audit_and_Completion_Goal.md` was read completely and used as the continuation brief. A human should decide whether the filename should be normalized later.
